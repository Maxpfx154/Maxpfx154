## Hi, I'm Max 👋

I'm a 20-year-old student from Bavaria focusing on computer science, AI workflows and automation.  
On this GitHub profile I share experiments, small tools and workflows around productivity, automation and knowledge management.

### What I'm into

- AI-assisted workflows and prompt engineering
- Automation with tools like n8n
- Clean note-taking and knowledge systems (e.g. Obsidian)
- Web basics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and some VBA

### Currently

- Exploring how to automate job and recruiting-related workflows
- Building small scripts and automations to save time in study and everyday work
- Learning more about modern backends, APIs and data workflows

### Get in touch

- Feel free to open an issue or discussion on any repo
